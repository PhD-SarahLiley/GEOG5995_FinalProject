# GEOG5995_FinalProject
Supporting information for Masters python programming module

## Background to my project
* Add section here

## This repository contains the following files
* jupyter notebook contain the code and final visualisations
* downloaded adult social care activity data (ASCFR and SALT Data Tables 2021-22)
* downloaded local authority shapefile data (England_utla_2022_bgc)
* downloaded Index of Multiple Deprivation data (File_11_-_IoD2019_Local_Authority_District_Summaries__upper-tier__)

## What the code aims to do
* The notebook contains code which will outline the additional datasets I linked data with, to provide further context, and the process I followed.

* I used the five stages of data science process as per the course materials; Collection, Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Building and Model Deployment, adopting an iterative process, with checks after each step, so that if any issues emerged, they could be quickly rectified.
  
## Further information required to run code and reproduce analysis
This code assumes that the spatial environment has already been loaded, and that the following packages are already installed, ready for import.

* seaborn 
* matplotlib.pyplot 
* pandas 
* numpy 
* scipy 
* geopandas 

## Further information on Adult Social Care
