# GEOG5995_FinalProject
Working document for Masters python programming module

## background to my project
* Adult social care in England is means-tested, unlike the NHS which is free at the point of contact. Where individuals are eligible for state support (that is, <>), this support is arranged by local authorities. 

* Local authorities (unlike other geographical boundaries such as electoral wards or LSOAs) vary in size and so I chose to use adult social care data that had already been linked with population data, to provide a uniform metric for standardisation and comparison.

## This repository contains the following files
* jupyter notebook contain the code and final visualisations
* downloaded adult social care activity data (add file name here)
* downloaded local authority shapefile data (add file name here)
* downloaded Index of Multiple Deprovation data (add file name here)

## what the code aims to do
* The notebook contains code which will outline the additional datasets I linked data with, to provide further context, and the process I followed.

* I used the five stages of data science process as per the course materials; Collection, Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Building and Model Deployment, adopting an iterative process, with checks after each step, so that if any issues emerged, they could be quickly rectified.
  
## further information required to run code and reproduce analysis
* This code assumes that the spatial environment has already been loaded, and that the following packages <> are already installed, ready for import.
